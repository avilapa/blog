### The Engine

<p align="justify">
<b>vxr</b> is an open source project that emerged from the desire to build a <b>general purpose rendering tool</b> that I could use to implement anything I was curious about or wanted to learn about.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As it stands now, it is a <b>multithreaded 3D game development engine written in C++</b> and oriented to support different rendering backends. The engine has two different APIs for development:
</p>
</p>

 
  - A <b>lower level API</b> based on render display list commands that can be used to build <b>small but efficient</b> applications.
  - A <b>higher level API</b> built on top of the lower level one, which abstracts it to provide a <b>rendering agnostic and component oriented</b> API.
