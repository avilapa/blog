I am a spanish <b>graphics programmer working at <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a></b> in Edinburgh, Scotland. Before that I developed <a href="/fuel-renegades" target="_blank"><i>Fuel Renegades (PC, Steam)</i></a> while studying at <a href="https://www.esat.es/" target="_blank">ESAT Valencia</a>, and <i>bad_alloc (PS4)</i> while studying at <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Sheffield Hallam University</a>.

During my career I have gained <b>experience developing for PC and the current generation of consoles</b> across multiple disciplines, though I feel most comfortable in graphics and engine programming (I save my <i>programmer art</i> only for game jams). I am always looking forward to grow my skills and improve as a coder and a person, that's why I drive all my projects with enthusiasm, creativity, proactivity and positivity (and a <i>fair bit</i> of humor).

My passion for graphics is rendered brightest (<i>haha!</i>) in <b><i>real-time</i> physically based material appearance</b>, that's why lately I've been working on an extended single-layered material model based on the <i>Microfacet Theory</i> for my own <i>open-source</i> engine, <i><b><a href="https://github.com/avilapa/vxr/" target="_blank">vxr (Github)</a></b></i>.
