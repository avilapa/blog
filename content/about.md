I am a videogames programming student who just obtained an HND in <a href="https://www.esat.es/" target="_blank">ESAT Valencia</a>, and is currently developing <b><a href="/fuel-renegades" target="_blank">Fuel Renegades</a></b>, an Unreal Engine 4 racing multiplayer game with a small student team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ModularSouls/" target="_blank">Modular Souls</a>.
I am very interested in graphics programming, so at the moment I am also building a 
small <a href="/render-engine" target="_blank"><b>real-time engine</b> in <i>C++</i> and <i>OpenGL</i> named <b>UPyDK</b></a>.

I have plans of obtaining my bachelor degree next year in Sheffield Hallam University.
