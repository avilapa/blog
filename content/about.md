[//]: # (Comment)

<p align="justify">
I am a final year games development student (programmer) in <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Sheffield Hallam University</a>. I am a very <b>enthusiastic and motivated</b> person, looking forward to begin my career in the industry and to provide my team with <b>proactivity and creativity</b>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
I have worked in <b>one published title in PC</b> while in college, and I am currently <b>working on a second one for the PS4</b> (both in Unreal Engine 4). Also when I got the chance I participated in Game Jams using Unity 3D.
</p>
<p align="justify">
However what I am <b>really enthusiastic about</b>, more than games, is computer graphcis. That is why I use my free time to develop and expand my knowledge in <b>graphics and engine programming</b>, having built various engines at the time as personal learning exercises. In fact, <b>you can check out my latest engine work, as it is published open source in <a href="https://github.com/avilapa/vxr/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></b>.

#### Background

<p align="justify">
Last year I obtained my HND at <a href="https://www.esat.es/" target="_blank">ESAT Valencia</a>, while developing <b><a href="/fuel-renegades" target="_blank">Fuel Renegades</a>, an UE4 racing arcade multiplayer game that is now playable on Steam</b>. My role as a programmer for the game was mainly to develop all the gameplay movement mechanics with special emphasis on the feeling and speed of the vehicles, to implement several postprocessing effects, and to build <b><a href="/post/framerate-independent-physics-in-ue4/" target="_blank">framerate independent physics using UE4 substepping</a></b>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I am very interested in <b>graphics and engine programming</b> so last year I also developed my own <b><a href="/render-engine" target="_blank">C++ rendering engine</a></b> featuring many interesting graphics features and <b><a href="/post/custom-engine-pbr/" target="_blank">physically based rendering techniques</a></b>.
</p>

#### Current Projects

<p align="justify">
At the moment I am developing a <b><a href="/vxr-engine" target="_blank">new engine called vxr</a></b> in my free time called (which was <a href="https://github.com/avilapa/vxr/" target="_blank">recently published open source on GitHub</a>!), taking what I learned from the last one and improving it greatly. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
For the 3D Games Prototyping subject I am building an <b>UE4 roguelike game for the PS4</b> with a small group of great programmers. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Also, for my Final Year Project, I will be looking at implementing several <b>extensions to the single-layered general physically based material model</b> (based on the Microfacet Theory) in BGFX. This extensions include: <b>anisotropy</b>, <b>thin-film interference (iridiscence)</b>, <b>clear coating (varnishes)</b>.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I am looking for my first opportunity in the industry starting 2019, and I am highly motivated to start!
