I am a videogames programming student in Valencia, Spain. Currently I am on 
my third year of ESAT, developing __Fuel Renegades__, an Unreal Engine 4 racing multiplayer 
game with a small student team, [Modular Souls](http://twitter.com/ModularSouls).
I am very interested in graphics programming, so at the moment I am also building a 
small __real-time engine__ in _C++_ and _OpenGL_ named __UPyDK__.

I have plans of obtaining my bachelor degree next year in Sheffield Hallam University
